Stolen from [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/easy-canned-chickpea-hummus). Boiling canned chickpeas in water for 20 minutes before pur√©eing them gives you the silky-smooth texture you normally only get in hummus made from dried beans.

## Ingredients

- 2 (15-oz.) cans chickpeas, drained, rinsed
- 6 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 6 Tbsp. tahini
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving

## Instructions

1. Place chickpeas in a medium pot and cover with water by 1". Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, undisturbed, until chickpeas start falling apart, about 20 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid, then drain chickpeas.
1. Transfer chickpeas to a food processor. Add garlic, lemon juice, tahini, salt, and 2 Tbsp. reserved cooking liquid and process for a full 5 minutes (set a timer for this) until creamy and smooth. If at any point the hummus appears dry or very thick, add cooking liquid 1 Tbsp. at a time. With the motor running, stream in oil and process just until combined. Transfer to a medium bowl and drizzle with more oil.
