This is the first recipe on Food Buddies. Yeah, it's a cheeseburger, but it has carmelized onions on it! 

## Ingredients
- some butter
- 2lbs ground beef (each lb makes ~2-3 patties)
- 1 large or 2 medium onions
- a bit of water
- salt and pepper
- 2-3 slices of cheese per burger
- buns (1 per burger duh)
- mayonnaise
- lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup, etc. for toppings
- a bit of vegetable oil

## Instructions
1. In a large skillet, melt the butter. Add the onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, about 40 minutes. Add the water and scrape up any browned bits. Cook until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Season the caramelized onion with salt and pepper; keep warm.
2. Gently shape the beef into ~1-inch-thick patties. Season generously with salt and pepper. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil. Cook the burgers over moderately high heat until deep brown outside and medium-rare within, about 6 minutes per side. During the last 2 minutes, top the burgers with the cheese.
3. Cut the buns in half, spread mayo on the bottom bun. Transfer the burgers to the buns, top with the caramelized onions and other toppings.
